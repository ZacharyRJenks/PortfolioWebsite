# PortfolioWebsite
my first website that I will use to show off all of my projects and skills to prospective employers

I used a Udemy video to learn the basics of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to put together this website. It will eventually be hosted as a static website from an s3 bucket on Amazon Web services.

I will continously improving this site as my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript grow!
